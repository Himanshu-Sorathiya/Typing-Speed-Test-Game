# Typing Speed Test

## Overview

This project is a typing speed test application designed to evaluate users' typing speed and accuracy. Users are presented with a pre-generated paragraph and have 60 seconds to type it. The application tracks their performance, providing metrics such as Words Per Minute (WPM), Characters Per Minute (CPM), and the number of mistakes made.

- **Dynamic Cursor**: The cursor moves character by character as the user types.
- **Color Feedback**: Correctly typed characters turn green, while incorrect ones turn red. The user can use backspace to correct mistakes.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Time Remaining**: Displays the remaining time underneath the paragraph.
  - **Mistake Counter**: Tracks the number of mistakes made.
  - **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Measures typing speed in words per minute.
  - **CPM (Characters Per Minute)**: Measures typing speed in characters per minute.
- **Restart Functionality**: A button to reset the test and start over.
